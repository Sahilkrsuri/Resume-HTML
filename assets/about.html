<h2>SAHIL SURI</h2>
<p>Hey there! I'm Sahil Suri, a second-year student studying Information Technology at Techno International New Town, a worst tier 3 private college.
   I love techie stuff, like coding and making software, and I'm part of open source projects where people work together on cool tech things.
    Outside of classes, I'm super into making content, like videos and stories, to share what I'm learning. 
    I'm all about exploring new things and figuring out what I find exciting. When I'm not doing tech stuff,
    I enjoy watching movies to relax and traveling to see new places. College life is an adventure, 
    and I'm excited to mix my studies with my passion for tech and creative projects. Let's connect and share the journey!</p>
